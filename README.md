# BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION FOR ATMs
Biometric authentication uses unique physical characteristics, such as a person's face or voice, to verify their identity. When applied to ATMs, this type of authentication can provide an additional layer of security beyond traditional methods, such as a PIN or magnetic stripe card. For example, a person's face can be scanned by the ATM's camera and compared to a stored image on file, while their voice can be analyzed for specific characteristics and compared to a stored voiceprint. By using both face and voice recognition, the ATM can confirm the person's identity with a high degree of accuracy, reducing the likelihood of fraud or unauthorized access.<br>
